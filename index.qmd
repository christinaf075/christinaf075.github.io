## About

Welcome to my academic website! My name is Christina Fan and I'm a third-year Psychology BSc student minoring in Neuroscience at the University of Waterloo.

## Research Interests

My research interests lie at the intersection of cognitive neuroscience and health, specifically the underlying neural mechanisms and biological processes that play a role in cognitive processes like memory, perception, and other functions.

I'm currently involved in two projects: Exploring the Effects of Aging on Multisensory Integration using ppTMS and Examining tDCS impact on reading skills of patients with visual deficits.
